# Candidate Progress Tracking Procedure

## **Overview**

This repository contains a stored procedure, `usp_TrackCandidateProgress`, designed to support the Council on Teacher Education (CoTE) in monitoring licensure progress for candidates across multiple programs. The procedure automates the tracking and reporting of candidate progress, identifies those at risk of non-compliance, and generates detailed reports for faculty and administrators.

## **Key Features**

1. **Dynamic Progress Tracking**:
   - Calculates candidatesâ€™ progress by comparing completed requirements to total program requirements.
   - Flags candidates with incomplete requirements and identifies missing components.

2. **Automated Reporting**:
   - Generates an HTML-formatted report for easy readability.
   - Prints the report for quick verification.

3. **Proactive Risk Management**:
   - Ensures compliance with licensure requirements by identifying and addressing gaps early.

4. **Ease of Use**:
   - Includes a single SQL setup script for seamless deployment.
